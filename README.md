# Optimization in Portfolio Allocation for an Arbitrary Number of Assets
Worked with a team of 4 people total to find methods to optimize a portfolio with an arbitrary number of assets. Used a gradient based constrained optimization algorithm to find the optimal portfolio allocation given n stocks. Descent direction determined using “generalized gradients”. Constraints were 1) the sum of allocations must equal total capital available and 2) only long positions are allowed.
